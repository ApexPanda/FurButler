## Description: 
We have created an application to find a service provider for your pet, create your own profile with sections showing your pets, be able to post about your pet, and to review the service providers.

## Motivation
We wanted to build an application to assist you in finding services available to your pet. This is also a way to connect with people in your area, with the profiles making that aspect more personal.

## Result 
Using each team members experience, we worked very well together to create an application that allows a pet owner to create their own profile, to find service providers for their pet, and to view their profiles as well. Our application connects pet lovers everywhere!

## Features:
Create an account/login to your own account 
Create your own profile 
Add pets to your profile 
Find a service provider based on the service they offer 
Go to their profile 
See their reviews or their pets
Chat with other people who have accounts/profiles 

## Team Efforts and Individual Responsibilities 

###### Kayla Tryon
###### Github username: ApexPanda
###### Contributions: 
Worked on the chat application functionality, getting the project deployed, encrypted the passwords when stored into the database, created the users table and seeds, added service providers/pet owners to the table later on, and created our custom API for retrieving information from the backend. 

###### Dominic Ojeda
###### Github username: dojeda1
###### Contributions: 
Designed the "Create an Account" page and connected it to the backend, designed and created the users profile pages and connected the pets and reviews on the profiles to the backend, designed the color scheme and background for the site. Worked on profile and edit pages and styled/animated the chat page.

###### Greg Olson
###### Github username: mountainflow
###### Contributions: 
Moved the login functionality into React, created functinal redirects between pages, designed the logo, connected the "Login" with the backend, added the favicon for tabs, created the login modal, designed and created the services output page, and designed and created the home page. 

###### Emily Robinson 
###### Github username: emssslay
###### Contributions:
Setup backend API routes, pet routes and table, review routes and table, user routes and added to table. Also setup the models for each and validated the API was getting data from the database. Worked on getting the project deployed and the Messages page, functionality for the chats. 

## Challenges 
Some challenges that we faced were getting the app deployed onto heroku, finding a chat application to integrate with, converting our previous project into React, and changing profiles using React state.

## Improvements 
We would like this to be an application that uses location services. Right now, you can only search by which service you are looking for. We do show that persons location, but it could be any person in any place, you'll just see everyone. We would also like to connect to the google API to be able to add another feature where you could search for pet stores and for more info on parks. We would also like to add code coverage.

## Requirements for the Project:
Must use ReactJS in some way (even if minimal)
